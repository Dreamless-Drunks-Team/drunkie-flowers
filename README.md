# Drunkine Flowers

This project aims to design an application that simulates the operations of a network of flower shops. The app will offer customers a variety of bouquets, either from a catalog or custom-designed for specific occasions such as weddings, birthdays, Valentine's Day, and funerals. 

Key features of the application include:
- **Bouquet Options**: Customers can choose from pre-designed bouquets in the catalog or request custom arrangements.
- **Event-Specific Proposals**: Special bouquet options for various events like weddings, birthdays, Valentine's Day, and funerals.
- **Additional Services**: Options for packaging, delivery, and discounts.
- **Variations**: Multiple packaging and delivery methods.
- **User Notifications**: Alerts for new arrivals, order readiness, and bonus accruals.
- **Customer Cards**: Different types of cards such as Gold (offering free delivery), Bonus, and Social cards.
- **Personal Account**: A personal dashboard where users can place orders and view current information.
